## Getting data

TODO: write a script to get, organize, and format data. Or
at least point to where it all can be downloaded from. They
are all public and well-known resources.

All data is stored in the `data` directory, including

- Reference genomes
- GEVA Atlas allele ages
- tsdate-inferred trees
- Relate-inferred allele ages
- Thousand Genomes Project VCFs and samples file
